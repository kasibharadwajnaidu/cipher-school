Lecture9- Implementation Of Objects And Inheritance

package coreJava;
public class Students {
int rollNo; //Camel Casing 
String name;
public static void main(String[] args){
Students s1 = new Students();
Students s2 = new Students();
Students s3 = new Students();
s1.name = "Ram";
s1.rollNo = 1;
s2.name = "Sham";
s2.rollNo = 2;
s3.name = "Ram";
s3.rollNo = 3;
}
}


Inheritance 
1.using inheritance,we can create new classes from already existing classes.
2.Existing classes from which new classes are derived are called base/parent/super classes.
3.new classes are called dervied/child/sub classes

package inheritance;
class Shape{ //Parent class, base class, super class
double pi=3.14;
double getSquare(int r)
{
return r*r;
}
}
class Circle extends Shape{ //child class, derived class, sub class
void area(int r){
System.out.println(pi*getSquare(r));
}
}
public class InheritanceStudy {
public static void main(String[] args){
Circle c = new Circle();
c.area(5);
}
}

there are 4 types of inheritance 
1.single level inheritance
2.multi-level inheritance
3.hierarchical inheritance
4.hybrid inheritance
5.multiple inheritance - not allowed in java through java
